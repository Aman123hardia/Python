# n=lambda n:n*n
# print(n(4))

# No, you can't write multiline lambda in Python because the lambda functions can have only one expression. 
# The creator of the Python programming language â€“ Guido van Rossum, answered this question in one of his blogs. 
# where he said that it's theoretically possible, but the solution is not a Pythonic way to do that

# s=lambda a,b:a if a>b else b
# print(s(2))                      # use if else as ternary
