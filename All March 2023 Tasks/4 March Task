1] what is web 3.0?
Web 3.0, sometimes known as Web 3, is the concept of the next generation of the web, in which most users will be connected via a     decentralized (Decentralization is the process of shifting control from one main group to several smaller ones.) network and have access to their own data.

The semantic web, known as Web 3.0, focuses on efficiency and intelligence by reusing and linking data across websites. On the other hand, the decentralized web also known as web3, puts a strong emphasis on security and empowerment by returning control of data and identity to users.
 
Popular Web3 networks include Ethereum, Solana, Polygon and Cosmos. Some popular Web3 platforms include OpenSea, Coinbase, Ledger and MetaMask. Many of these networks and platforms sell NFTs(NFT stands for 'non-fungible token'. Non-fungible means that something is unique and can't be replaced. By contrast, physical money and cryptocurrencies are fungible, which means they can be traded or exchanged for one another) or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Who is the founder of Web3?
The term "Web3" was coined by Polkadot founder and Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood in 2014, referring to a "decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain." In 2021, the idea of Web3 gained popularity.

Why Web 3.0 is important for the future?
Web 3.0 will remove some control from tech giants, making the Internet more decentralized and democratic. Smart contracts and the blockchain can reduce the need for third-party service providers, which can both reduce business costs and add extra layers of security


In simpler terms, a TLD is everything that follows the final dot of a domain name. For example, in the domain name 'google.com', '.com' is the TLD. Some other popular TLDs include '. org.


Solidity, Vyper, Python, and Rust are the most used programming languages for creating web3 applications.
